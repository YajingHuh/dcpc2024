# Synthesis: Governance Models for Digital Commons #

**Introduction** <br>
Digital commons are distinctive from other digital goods because of their collective and democratic governance, namely in direct and participatory decision-making ([Commons Network](https://www.commonsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3rd-Explainer-eng-1.pdf)). Their governance models are different from those of their private counterparts in that the governance of digital commons intentionally replaces hierarchical structures with more distributed and decentralized models. Based on the division of labor, the governance of digital commons can be categorized into three models: Community-Foundation (CF), Community-Business (CB), and Community-Cooperative (CC). These models vary in their structures and implementations, which reflect different advantages and drawbacks.

**Governance models** <br>
*Community-Foundation (CF)* <br>
Under the CF model, digital commons are operated by two agencies–the volunteer-driven communities and the nonprofit foundations. Foundations are responsible for supporting the community through such means as licensing, fundraising, and administrative tasks. They operate on a non-profit basis that prioritizes the functioning of the digital commons and its community, which establishes and maintains open-source services with support from the foundation.

One important benefit of the CF model is that it prevents a single contributor from exerting exclusive control of key project resources ([Neary](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-open-source-governance-models)). By having a non-profit association manage the entity, the CF model ensures that no individual participant can dominate key aspects of the project. Nevertheless, the CF model is also subject to several drawbacks. One comes from its limited capacity to attract larger open-source projects due to the limited funding and legal requirements of non-profit organizations.

A good example of CF model governance is Matrix ([website](https://matrix.org/)), in which the non-profit Matrix.org Foundation manages important administrative tasks to ensure the proper operation of the Matrix community. While the nonprofit foundation has maintained a relatively equal environment of participation, it suffers from financial difficulties and has been only able to attract clients and servers of subpar qualities ([Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38336736)).

*Community-Business (CB)* <br>
In order to reach potential developers and users, some individual companies may decide to distribute software under the terms of an open-source license. This collaboration between a business entity and a digital commons community to build open-source digital resources is the CB model. Under this model, the governing organization may choose not to accept external contributions, or require a contributor agreement (CLA) to accept a contribution ([Ferreira](https://isabellafer.medium.com/open-source-governance-models-explained-723a3ffd59b6))

Compared with the CF model, an advantage of the CB governance model is its access to capital and expertise, which can facilitate development activity and accelerate the adoption processes of developers’ contributions ([Neary](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-open-source-governance-models)). However, this model is also criticized for its lack of openness. Although some projects claim to support an open community, they are, in fact, fully controlled by a business entity, which makes its democraticness questionable and creates concerns and hesitancy for potential contributors.

Android ([website](https://www.android.com/)) is perhaps the most well-known illustration of the CB governance model. Backed by Google, the development of the Android system enjoys numerous funding opportunities and expertise. Android also has a vast community globally that contributes to the development and optimization of the system. 

Although Android is open-source through the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), it remains under Google's control. This means that Google can influence the direction of the project and decide which features to implement. For instance, after Android gained significant traction in the mobile market, Google shifted its strategy by reintroducing closed-source software into the ecosystem ([Coopossum](https://medium.com/@coopossum/how-open-source-is-android-8d1815b9a42d)). In short, the case of Android demonstrates how the CB model can present challenges to the openness of the digital commons community.

*Community-Cooperative (CC)* <br>
Under the CC model, the operation of digital commons takes place in cooperation among community members. Community members are also co-owners. These members share responsibilities in decision-making and elect personnel to manage the project’s operations ([Neary](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-should-i-run-my-community-elections)). Additionally, any profits generated are distributed among the co-owners.

One major benefit of the CC model is its democratic governance, where members elect leaders through formal elections. This ensures that decision-making aligns with the community's collective interests. However, the CC model also has its drawbacks. For example, decision-making can become inefficient. Elections can sometimes be contentious, time-consuming, and distracting for community members if the community doesn't have specifically codified term limits and documentation.

The New York-based Drivers Cooperative is a great example of the CC model ([Commons Network](https://www.commonsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3rd-Explainer-eng-1.pdf)). Founded in 2021, it operates through the Co-op Drive and Co-op Ride apps and has roughly 3,000 drivers who share legal ownership of the platform. Community members elect a new board every two years. They also vote on key business decisions such as distributing profits based on hours worked. Although the technology is not open source, the cooperative structure demonstrates its shared ownership governance.

**Conclusion** <br>
In summary, each governance model—CF, CB, and CC—shows different ways to manage digital commons with distinctive advantages and drawbacks. The CF model works for fairness but lacks funds, whereas the CB model gains more funding opportunities but loses openness. Moreover, the CC model builds trust and fairness within the community but can have lengthy decision-making processes. While each of these models presents its own benefits and challenges, the digital commons community should choose wisely the model that best fits their agenda and developmental needs.
